# Making your own effects.
If you want to work on your own effects, you can either make a copy of the Workshop version.
Or if you want to be working on the latest version, make a clone of this repository.
Make sure to clone it into your local mods folder so you can test it without any hassle.

That folder can be found here: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Teardown\mods\
This is where the game copies mods too aswell.

# About
This mod started as an experiment for myself but quickly turned into something functional.
Now this mod is a collaberation between dev behind the first Chaos mod for Teardown [superfroggman](https://github.com/superfroggman)
and myself. With me working on the game code and him working something big (no spoilers yet!)

This mod is based on the Chaos mods from the GTA series.
